  ## About me
 Born and raised in Brazil, where I lived for 20 years, I moved to Portugal to gain new experiences and pursue my education.

I am currently a Software Engineering student at the University of Minho, where I have acquired a strong foundation in general programming, software development and code testing. I am also pursuing a master's degree with a specialization in Lexical Engineering and Formal Methods of Programming.

My involvement in the student association of Software Engineering, [CeSIUM](https://github.com/cesium), has been extensive. I began as a Collaborator, advanced to Director of the Pedagogical Department, then served as Treasurer and ultimately held the position of President.

In addition, I volunteer at [Coder Dojo Braga](https://github.com/coderdojobraga), where I mentor children aged 7 to 17 in programming and application development.

I also completed a summer internship at [Yari Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yarilabs/) as a backend developer, gaining valuable industry experience.

As a student athlete, I represent the University of Minho Swimming Team, competing at the National University Level.

Feel free to contact me for any collaborations or opportunities!
