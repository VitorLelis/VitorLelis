## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vitor

I was born and raised in Brazil, where I spent the first 20 years of my life before moving to Portugal to explore new opportunities and continue my education.

Iâ€™m currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Minho, where Iâ€™ve gained a strong foundation in programming, software development, and code testing. Iâ€™m also working on a masterâ€™s degree focused on Lexical Engineering and Formal Methods of Programming.
